# System Architecture

The project consists of four components working together.

## Dashboard

The Laravel dashboard serves as the central interface where users can:

- View tracked activity
- Monitor application usage
- Analyze productivity statistics
- Manage their account
- Receive notifications

**Technologies**

- Laravel
- PHP
- SQL
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

---

## Server

The server acts as the communication layer between the tracking applications and the dashboard.

It receives activity data, processes it, and stores it in the database for visualization inside the dashboard.

---

## Window Tracker

A desktop application that monitors which Windows applications are currently active.

Examples include:

- Visual Studio
- VS Code
- Chrome
- Discord
- Steam
- Spotify

The collected activity is sent to the server.

---

## Tab Tracker

A custom Chrome Extension that tracks individual browser tabs instead of treating Google Chrome as a single application.

This provides much more detailed productivity information by identifying which websites are actually being used.

Examples:

- GitHub
- YouTube
- Stack Overflow
- ChatGPT
- Google Docs
